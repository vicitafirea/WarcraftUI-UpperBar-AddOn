# WarcraftUI-UpperBar-AddOn
Addon crafted to work as a bar in the top of the screen, showing at a quick glance information or an update about the player's status. Used and was mostly functional in TurtleWoW

Last update was made in 09-08-2023.

The code is designed to mimic the user interface of Warcraft 3, in a way that is as versatile and adaptive as possible to the user's needs.

This is another AddOn made just for fun and not really as practical as it sounds.
